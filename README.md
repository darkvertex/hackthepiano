# HackThePiano

Hi,

My name is Wojciech. I've always dreamed about being able to play an instrument and last year, at the age of 30, I decided to start to learn playing the piano. I really enjoyed and doing this makes me happy. But there are always problems with basics at the beginning. I found that understanding notes on the fly is really a tricky part. But well... every problem has to find its solution.

Professinally I'm a software developer. So I decided to write small application which help me to learn reading the notes.
After a couple of days application was ready, I started to use it and found that after short time of training I really improved. So I decided to share the app with community hoping that all interested parties find it useful. It's completely free, opensourced piece of software available here: https://wojciechmalota.github.io/hackthepiano/

The challenge is very simple. You have to play note you see as fast as possible. To use it you need digital piano with MIDI interface connected to your computer. Website has to be opened in Chrome browser. By clicking "Your results" button you can see how fast and how accurate you are. There are different levels of difficulty.

I made this software mostly for fun so the only prize I can get is it's popularity. So if you find it useful and think it might help someone I will be very grateful for sharing this with your visitors, viewers, students etc.
I have other ideas for the small software tools that may help beginners to learn playing the piano. If I see that there is some interest in community then I will create them with great pleasure.
